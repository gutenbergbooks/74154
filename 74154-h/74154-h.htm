<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Introduction.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The usual laboratory solution of potassium permanganate must be
frequently restandardized. A slight loss in strength may be detected
after standing even a few days and this change becomes more rapid
as the decomposition proceeds. When one looks for the cause of this
increase in the rate of the decomposition of the permanganate, the
attention is naturally directed to the brown manganese oxide which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
separates from the solution. A desire to ascertain whether the presence
of this oxide influences the rate of the decomposition suggested the
experiments here described.</p>

<p>The fact that potassium permanganate may react with certain so-called
peroxides with evolution of oxygen, has long been known and it appeared
possible that a similar reaction may take place between manganese
dioxide and potassium permanganate.</p>

<p>Morse and Allen investigated the reaction between lead dioxide and
potassium permanganate and there is embodied in Allen’s dissertation<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
a statement of the earlier work in this line with references to the
literature on the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>They have shown that in the presence of a quantity of dilute nitric
acid which is equivalent to the potassium in the potassium permanganate
used, lead dioxide reduces the permanganate to manganese dioxide
without itself suffering reduction, while in the presence of an excess
of stronger nitric acid, e.g. normal to eight normal, the lead dioxide
is also reduced.</p>

<p>The following equations represent the reactions referred to:</p>

<p class="no-indent">I, when the nitric acid is equivalent to the potassium in the potassium
permanganate,</p>

<p class="f110 no-wrap"><b>2 KMnO₄ + 3 PbO₂ = K₂O + 3 PbO₂ + 2 MnO₂ + 1½ O₂.</b></p>

<p class="no-indent">II, when the nitric acid is in excess,</p>

<p class="f110 no-wrap"><b>2 KMnO₄ + 3 PbO₂ = K₂O + 3 PbO + 2 MnO₂ + 3 O₂.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
The reducing action of manganese dioxide upon potassium permanganate
was suspected from the observed increase in the rapidity of the
decomposition of potassium permanganate solutions. But only a
suggestion of such a reaction could be found in the literature.
Thénard,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
in 1856 states that manganese dioxide may act upon potassium
permanganate either as a reducing agent, in which act the manganese
dioxide is changed to a manganate, or its influence may be catalytic,
causing the evolution of oxygen. Again Mulder<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
in 1858, ascribed the decomposition of potassium permanganate solutions
to the presence of some potassium manganate.</p>

<p>It could not be ascertained that any investigation of this matter had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
ever been undertaken. It was therefore decided to study the question
and it appeared that the most satisfactory evidence could be obtained
by measuring the quantity of oxygen which is evolved when potassium
permanganate and manganese dioxide are brought together.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="DESCN_APP" class="nobreak">Description of Apparatus.</h2>
</div>

<p>The apparatus<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
employed in this work consists of four parts:</p>

<p>“1) a flask, A, in which the reactions were conducted. A melting point
bulb of about 40 cc. capacity, the diameter of its neck being 20 mm.,
was used for this purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img id="FIG_1" src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="630" >
</div>

<p>This was closed with a two-hole rubber stopper, through one hole of
which passed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
2) A small glass tube, <b>BB</b>, running up from the flask about 40 cm., and
then bent twice at right angles. One limb of this tube was surrounded
by a small Liebig’s condenser, while the shorter turned down to meet—</p>

<p>3) a Schiff’s azotometer filled with mercury and connected at its top
with the tube above mentioned. In practice it was found desirable to
have a little water on the top of the mercury column.</p>

<p>4) Through the second hole of the rubber stopper closing the flask was
passed a short piece of glass tubing bent obliquely just above the
stopper and tightly connected with a rubber tube about 50 cm. long,
<b>DD</b>. This tube was clamped near its lower end with a Mohr’s pinch-cock,
while the upper was connected with the stem of a small funnel, <b>F</b>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>When an experiment was to be conducted, the azotometer <b>C</b>, was connected to
the tube, <b>B</b>, and tied tightly, a piece of good rubber tubing being used
for the connection. The reservoir of the azotometer, <b>M</b>, was then raised
until the mercury had driven out all the air in <b>C</b>, and the stop-cock
closed. Next the funnel F was filled with water, the pinch-cock closing
<b>D</b> opened and the water allowed to flow down and drive out all the air
in the tube. The latter was then clamped and thus kept full of water.
The apparatus being now ready, the flask <b>A</b>, containing the substances
in the desired quantity, was made fast to <b>B</b> and <b>D</b> by means of its
stopper. The stop-cock of <b>C</b> opened. The flask <b>A</b> was heated in a water
bath for any desired time, the oxygen being collected in <b>C</b> as fast as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
it was given off.</p>

<p>At the end of the experiment, all the gases which remained in <b>A</b> and
<b>B</b> were driven over into C by lowering the reservoir <b>M</b> and opening the
pinch-cock at <b>D</b>. When this was accomplished the stop-cock of <b>C</b> was
closed and the gases brought under atmospheric pressure by bringing the
mercury in <b>C</b> and <b>M</b> to the same level.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in this gas volume was included the air which <b>A</b>
and <b>B</b> contained at the beginning of the experiment.</p>

<p>The oxygen evolved from the contents of the flask was determined thus:
After reading off the total volume of air and oxygen and reducing
to normal conditions, the total volume of oxygen was obtained by
absorption with phosphorus or pyrogallol, and from the residual
nitrogen could be calculated from the volume of air to be deducted
from the total volume of gases. The remainder is the volume of oxygen sought.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Action of manganese dioxide<br> on potassium

</div>

<p>Three sets of apparatus like the one described were used.</p>

<p>The flask of apparatus No. I contained manganese dioxide and dilute
nitric acid.</p>

<p>The flask of apparatus No. II contained potassium permanganate and
dilute nitric acid.</p>

<p>The flask of apparatus No. III contained potassium permanganate and
dilute nitric acid and manganese dioxide.</p>

<p>The manganese dioxide used in these experiments was precipitated from a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
solution of potassium permanganate by a dilute solution of manganous sulfate
in the manner described on <a href="#Page_34">page 34</a> and then washed
and dried at 100°C.</p>

<p>An illustration of the proportions in which the different substances
were brought together in each of the three flasks is to be found in the
following statement of the quantities used in the first experiment.</p>

<p>The variations from these proportions occurring in subsequent
experiments are noted in the table giving the summary of the results.
Usually about 150 m.g. of manganese dioxide were used and the solutions
in the three flasks were brought to the same volume by addition of
distilled water.

<p>The nitric acid in No. I is calculated to be the same as that remaining
free after the potassium of the permanganate in No. III has been
neutralized. It will be clear that the quantities of free nitric acid
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
are the same in flask No. I and in flask No. III provided the potassium
of the permanganate is appropriated by the nitric acid. Moreover each
flask contains the same quantity of manganese dioxide and the volume of
the liquid is the same in both.</p>

<p>On the other hand flask No. III contains permanganic acid. This
arrangement was selected in order to determine how far the evolution
of oxygen was influenced by the action of nitric acid on the manganese
dioxide or by the spontaneous decomposition of permanganic acid. It
was thought that if more oxygen should be obtained from flask No. III
containing a mixture of permanganate, manganese dioxide and nitric
acid, than from mixtures No. I and No. II, the larger volume must be due
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
to the reduction of the permanganate by the manganese oxide.</p>

<p>The three flasks after having been filled as described were attached to
the apparatus and then all submerged to the same depth in the boiling
water of a single glass water-bath. The stop-cocks of the azotometers
were then opened and the mercury allowed to fall to within about fifty
millimetres of its level in the reservoirs. This difference in level
was maintained as nearly as practicable by lowering the reservoirs
commenserably with the increase in gas volume. No action could be
observed in flasks No. I and No. II during the whole course of the
experiment. The contents of flask No. III however gave off bubbles of
oxygen immediately, the mercury fell in the azotometer and the dark
purple of the permanganate solution in flask No. III became rapidly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
lighter. Within about five minutes it was reduced to a delicate pink
but this tint persisted for about ten minutes when it also disappeared.
Immediately after the disappearance of the permanganate color the
solution was filled with a brown oxide which remained for about
thirty five minutes when it subsided leaving the supernatant liquid
clear. Notwithstanding the fact that the color of the permanganate
had entirely disappeared and the suspended oxide had subsided within
an hour after beginning the experiment, the flasks in the earlier
experiments were allowed to remain for two hours longer. By admitting
distilled water through the tube <b>D</b> [<a href="#FIG_1">see figure</a>]
the gas was then forced over into the azotometer. Finally, the oxygen
was determined in the manner previously described.

As at the end of the preceding calculation the results are expressed
in the table following in terms of oxygen atoms obtained from each
molecule of potassium permanganate [KMnO₄] reduced. Thus an equivalent
of one atom of oxygen from one molecule of potassium permanganate
would equal 15.96/157.67 of the weight of potassium permanganate used
in the experiment. This weight divided by the weight of one cubic
centimetre of oxygen gives the number of cubic centimetres of oxygen at
normal, equivalent to one atom of oxygen from one molecule of potassium
permanganate. The results obtained are tabulated as follows:

<p>Inspection of the table will show that whether the oxygen were
determined immediately after the subsidence of the oxides (i.e.
after fifty minutes) or after three hours the results obtained are
practically the same. The tendency of the potassium permanganate to
lose strength made the frequent preparation of new samples advisable.
Wherever a new sample has been used in the course of the experiments,
the fact has been noted in the table by an asterisk. It will be noticed
that where a new solution is used the figures for flask no. III are
immediately larger and nearer to one and one half atoms of oxygen
from each molecule of potassium permanganate.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>A phosphorus gas-pipette was used for the absorption of the oxygen in
all the experiments the results of which are embodied in the foregoing
table. In subsequent experiments an alkaline solution of pyrogallol was
employed. It is now known that the variation in the composition of the
manganese oxide in use had some influence upon the results.</p>

<p>It has also been found that the manganese dioxide prepared by the
reduction of permanganate by manganese sulphate is much less stable
than was supposed at the time this work was begun. The dioxide
prepared in this way begins immediately to lose oxygen spontaneously
but recovers the same in the presence of an excess of potassium
permanganate. In the light of these facts it is easy to understand why
lower results were obtained when the oxygen was determined immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
after the disappearance of the color of the permanganate and before
the suspended oxide had subsided. It appears that the manganese oxide
employed in these experiments was not, as was supposed at the time,
the dioxide but one containing a smaller proportion of oxygen. If such
is the case the first action of the permanganate upon it would be to
replace the oxygen which had been lost. The reduction of the remaining
permanganate would then probably be in accordance with the equation,</p>

<p class="f110 no-wrap"><b>2 KMnO₄ + 3 MnO₂ = 2 K₂O + 5 MnO₂ + 1½ O₂</b></p>

<p>At the time when the permanganate color disappears, all of the
manganese is in the dioxide condition and the further evolution of
oxygen, which is shown by the preceding experiments to take place
during the subsidence of the suspended oxides, is due to a partial
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
reduction of this manganese. Therefore the relation of the reduction
of the manganese oxide below the MnO₂ condition before the treatment
with permanganate to the reduction which follows the disappearance
of the permanganate color will determine whether the oxygen evolved
shall be more or less than one and one half atoms to each molecule of
permanganate.</p>

<p>Neither variations in the quantities of nitric acid used (from two to
three molecules in No. III) nor the very slight variations in
the amount of manganese dioxide used, seem to affect appreciably the
amount of oxygen obtained.</p>

<p>It appears that the action of manganese dioxide on potassium
permanganate is the same as that of lead superoxide<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
in the presence of very dilute nitric acid. Both reduce it to manganese
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
dioxide with the evolution of one and one half atoms of oxygen to each
molecule of the permanganate.</p>

<p>The evolution of oxygen from flask No. I containing manganese dioxide
and nitric acid is very slight. From flask No. II containing potassium
permanganate and one equivalent nitric acid, it is also slight but
usually greater than from flask No. I. The differences are much greater
in the case of those determinations in which the heating of the flask
was continued for three hours and in this fact is to be found further
evidence of the reducing action of manganese dioxide on potassium
permanganate.</p>

<p>The possibility of a reaction analogous to that between potassium
permanganate and lead dioxide in the presence of strong nitric acid
seems to be excluded by the fact that the higher oxides of manganese
may be prepared in the presence of concentrated nitric acid.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Action of a Black Oxide of Manganese<br>
on Potassium Permanganate.——</h2>
</div>

<p>As an analysis of the manganese dioxide showed the probable presence
of some manganese in the manganous condition, a sample was treated on
the water-bath for some days with dilute nitric acid while distilled
water was added from time to time to keep the dilution nearly constant.
This was done for the purpose of determining whether the manganous
manganese might not be extracted in the form of manganese nitrate. The
light brown oxide which was used in the previous experiments had been
prepared by adding a dilute solution of manganous sulphate to a hot
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
solution containing potassium permanganate in excess and dilute nitric
acid. No analysis of the oxide thus prepared was made at the time of
its preparation, but it has been shown by the work of others that the
oxide must have had at that time a composition as regards the relation
of manganese to oxygen, very nearly equivalent to that of MnO₂. During
the course of the experiments previously recorded, a determination of
the ratio of the manganese to the available oxygen in the compound was
made and found to be as</p>

<p class="f110"><b>1.03 : 1.00</b></p>

<p>The substance gave 54.69 percent manganese and 15.44 percent available
oxygen.</p>

<p>A second analysis made some weeks later gave a ratio of manganese to
available oxygen of 1.06: 1.00.—

<p>The manganese was determined by the method of Gibbs<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and the available oxygen by oxalic acid and potassium permanganate.</p>

<p>It was this oxide which was treated with nitric acid in the manner
described. In the course of this treatment the light brown color
changed to black and the oxide became heavier. The dilute nitric acid
in which the oxide had been digested was found to contain manganous
manganese, but analysis of the black product showed that the oxide had
suffered a still further reduction. The ratio of manganese to available
oxygen was found to have risen from 1.06: 1.00 to 1.157: 1.000. The
analytical data are given below:—

<p>The volume of the oxygen evolved is considerably smaller than that
obtained when the brown oxide was used. It is nevertheless larger
than could have been evolved if all of the manganese had been left
in the dioxide condition at the close of the experiment. This fact
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span><br>
indicates that there was a slight reduction of the manganese dioxide
after the disappearance of the color of the permanganate. That such a
reduction of manganese dioxide does take place will be made apparent
by a comparison of the results of the first two experiments in which
the oxygen was measured soon after the color of permanganate had
disappeared, with the results of the last two experiments in which the
oxygen was determined after a longer interval. It will be noticed in
this as in the series of experiments with the brown oxide that the rate
of the evolution of oxygen liberated in flask No. II increases
with the time of heating.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Stability of Manganese Dioxide.</h2>
</div>

<p>Having found in the course of the work already described that
manganese dioxide prepared in the wet way is much less stable than was
supposed, it was decided to make some experiments upon the spontaneous
decomposition which it undergoes. To this end a fresh sample was
prepared in the following manner.</p>

<p>10 grams of potassium permanganate were dissolved in 500 c.c. of
distilled water and the solution allowed to settle for one day. The
liquid was them filtered through glass wool, heated to 65°C. and treated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
with 320 c.c. N/10 nitric acid, having also a temperature of 65°C. 20.5
grams of manganous sulphate dissolved in 2.5 litres of water heated
to 65°C, were now added, with stirring, to the acidified solution of
potassium permanganate. The precipitate was allowed to settle and
the supernatant liquid which still retained the permanganate color,
decanted. The residue was then treated with water, stirred and allowed
to settle. The water was decanted and the oxide filtered. The filter
used consisted of two platinum cones between which was placed a small
paper filter which did not quite reach to the edge of the outer cone.
This filter was placed in the bottom of a glass funnel and the oxide
poured upon it. The oxide was repeatedly washed with distilled water
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
and then transferred to a porous plate. It was afterwards heated for
several hours to a temperature of 65°C. At this temperature it was
found impracticable to bring the oxide to a constant weight, but this
fact was no serious obstacle in the way of the subsequent work since
it was only desired to ascertain what changes take place in the ratio
of the manganese to the available oxygen. The manganese was determined
by the method of Gibbs and the available oxygen by oxalic acid and
potassium permanganate. An analysis of the oxide made shortly after its
preparation in the manner described, gave</p>

The results appearing in the table on the same horizontal lines are
those of experiments made simultaneously, that is, the flasks in these
experiments were immersed at the same time and in the same water-bath.
These, that is the results appearing on the same horizontal line,
and these only are comparable, since it was found that very slight
differences in the temperature of the bath were of great influence on
the length of time required for the reduction of the permanganate.</p>

<p>It is clear that the rate of the reduction of the permanganate is
greatly increased by increasing the quantity of the manganese oxide.</p>

every case filtered and the filtrate tested by Crum’s reaction for the
presence of manganese. No manganese was found. The absence of manganese
in the filtrate shows that the reduction of the permanganate was not
due to the formation of manganese nitrate, though it will be clear from
the results of subsequent experiments that the presence of nitric acid
exerts an influence on the rate of the reduction.</p>

<p>In these experiments, the manganese oxide used was prepared in the same
manner as that in which the proportion of manganese to available oxygen
was found immediately after its preparation to be</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
It was dried for several days at 65°C., but for almost a month after
its preparation was not used. Hence, what the ratio of the manganese
to the oxygen at the time when the permanganate was treated with it,
is quite uncertain. It however appears probable from the subsequent
experiments on the instability of manganese dioxide at 65°C. that the
ratio of manganese to available oxygen must have been at about 1.05:
1.00 corresponding to a formula MnO·20MnO₂.</p>

<p>Two solutions of permanganate were made, filtered through glass wool
and standardized.</p>

<p><b>Solution A.</b></p>

<p>A cubic centimetre of this was found to be equivalent to 14.379 m.g.
iron in the ferrous condition.

was added 0.5 gram of the manganese oxide previously referred to. The

showed a decline in strength of 78.86 percent.</p>

<p>The conclusions to be drawn from the foregoing results are (1) that
dilute solutions of potassium permanganate are more stable both in
diffused light and in darkness than the more concentrated ones, and (2)
that the presence of manganese oxides hasten to an enormous degree the
reduction of potassium permanganate even at summer temperatures. It
will also be observed that this reducing action of the manganese oxide
is greater in the stronger than in the more dilute solutions. It should
be remarked that the summer of 1892 in which these experiments were
made, was one of unusual heat.</p>

<p>The oxide used in these experiments was one which had been prepared
in the manner heretofore described by adding manganese sulphate to an
excess of potassium permanganate. Soon after its preparation the ratio
of manganese to available oxygen in it was found to be</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>

manganese to available oxygen was found to be</p>

<p class="f110"><b>1.198 : 1.000</b></p>

<p>Corresponding very nearly to the ratio of manganese to available oxygen
in MnO·5MnO₂.</p>

<p class="fs_110"><b>Experiment I.</b></p>

<p>230 m.g. of the oxide was treated with the quantity of permanganate
calculated to be necessary for its oxidation to manganese dioxide.
The mixture was kept at a temperature of 22°C. until the color of the
permanganate disappeared. This required about ten hours.</p>

<p>An analysis of the oxide then gave a ratio of manganese to available
oxygen</p>

<p class="f110"><b>1.027 : 1.000</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p class="fs_110"><b>Experiment II</b></p>

<p>A repetition of experiment I. An analysis of the oxide after
decolorization of the permanganate gave a ratio of manganese to
available oxygen of</p>

<p class="f110"><b>1.022 : 1.000</b></p>

<p class="fs_110"><b>Experiment III</b></p>

<p>The conditions are the same as in the preceding experiments except that
twice the amount of permanganate calculated for the conversion of the
oxide into manganese dioxide was added.</p>

<p>An analysis of the residue after decolorization gave a ratio of

<p class="fs_110"><b>Experiment IV</b></p>

<p>A repetition of experiment III. An analysis of the residue gave a ratio

<p class="f110"><b>0.995 : 1.000</b></p>

<p class="fs_110"><b>Experiment V</b></p>

<p>A repetition of experiments III and IV. The ratio of manganese to
available oxygen in the residue was</p>

<p class="f110"><b>0.995 : 1.000.</b></p>

<p>The foregoing results indicate (experiments III, IV, and V) that the
oxygen lost spontaneously by manganese dioxide prepared in the wet way,
is fully recovered when the reduced oxide is treated with excess of
potassium permanganate.</p>

<p>The ratio of the manganese to the available oxygen was determined in
the following manner. The contents of the flask were filtered through
asbestos and the flask and the precipitate washed with cold water. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
contents of the filter were then returned to the flask and treated with
an excess of a standard solution of oxalic acid and dilute sulphuric
acid. After reduction the excess of the oxalic acid was determined by a
standard solution of potassium permanganate.</p>

<p>The solution was then filtered, well washed and the manganese in the
filtrate precipitated by the method of Gibbs. From the total amount of
manganese found, there was deducted the quantity which was introduced
in determining the excess of oxalic acid by potassium permanganate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Summary of Conclusions—</h2>
</div>

<p class="fs_110 no-indent"><b>I</b></p>

<p>Potassium permanganate in weakly acid, in neutral, and in alkaline
solutions, is reduced by manganese dioxide which has been prepared in
the wet way, with evolution of one and one half atoms of oxygen for
each molecule of the permanganate. In other words, the permanganate is
reduced to manganese dioxide.</p>

<p class="fs_110 no-indent"><b>II</b></p>

<p>This reduction is most rapid in acid and slowest in alkaline solutions.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p class="fs_110 no-indent"><b>III</b></p>

<p>The rate of reduction is greatly increased by increasing the proportion
of manganese dioxide.</p>

<p class="fs_110 no-indent"><b>IV</b></p>

<p>In concentrated solutions of potassium permanganate, the reduction by
manganese dioxide is relatively more rapid than in dilute.</p>

<p class="fs_110 no-indent"><b>V</b></p>

<p>Manganese oxide, prepared in the wet way i.e. by the addition
of manganese sulphate to a hot solution containing an excess of
permanganate, has the composition MnO₂ as regards the ratio of
manganese to available oxygen.</p>

<p class="fs_110 no-indent"><b>VI</b></p>

<p>This oxide is unstable. It loses oxygen spontaneously even at ordinary
temperatures.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p class="fs_110 no-indent"><b>VII</b></p>

<p>The oxygen which is thus lost is recovered when the oxide is again
treated with an excess of potassium permanganate.</p>

<p class="fs_110 no-indent"><b>VIII</b></p>

<p class="spb1">It is suggested that a partial explanation of the reduction of
potassium permanganate by manganese oxide may be found in the
instability of the latter; in other words that the reduction may
consist in alternate reduction and reoxidation processes. But when the
rapidity of the reduction is taken into account, it seems probable that
a reaction analogous to that between permanganic acid and hydrogen
superoxide must also take place.</p>
